            <h2>How Many Should We Put You Down For?</h2>
            <p>Posted by Brian on October 1st,2013 at 2:39PM</p>
            <p>The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves
                empty-handed, they're likely not going to come back.
                That's why you have to be somewhat aggressive when 
                you're working with a customer, but you have to make sure 
                you don't overdo it and scare them away.

                One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions that have yes or no 
                answers.For example, if you're selling a service plan, don't ever ask "Are you interested in our 3 
                or 5 year service plan?" Instead, ask "Are you interested in the 3 year service plan or the 5 year 
                plan,which is a better value?" At first glance, they appear be asking the same thing, and while
                a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of the second question because they 
                have to say more than just "no".
